# Workshop: Monitoring Go Applications with Prometheus

⚠️ ***Please note that the content may not be representative of Ecosia's current engineering standards.***

## Objective

In the directory `app/`, we have a simple Go application. We want to start observing the behaviour of this application at runtime, by tracking and exporting metric data.

We will do this using the time-series database system [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), which uses a "pull" method to extract data from running applications. This means that the applications need to "export" their data, so that Prometheus is able to "scrape" the metric data from them. This is typically done via an HTTP endpoint (`/metrics`, by convention).

We will use the [Prometheus Go client library](https://godoc.org/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus) to track metrics in our code, and to export the metrics on `/metrics`.

## Content

### Section 1: Exporting default metrics

For this section, you can `cd` into `app/` and use `go run main.go` to run the dev server. (Docker will be used later)

Exporting basics:

Read the documentation or examples about the Prometheus Go client. In particular, you can check the [simple example](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/master/examples/simple/main.go) which demonstrates usage of the `promhttp` - this includes a `.Handler()` function which returns an `http.Handler`. The Prometheus Go client exports many metrics by default (about the Go runtime, eg. garbage collection), so you can export just these default metrics by simply attaching the `promhttp` handler to an `http.Server`. For example, you can call `http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())`. You should then be able to start the server, and see some default metrics being exported on `/metrics`.


### Section 2: Exporting custom metrics

Then, you'll want to track and export custom metrics. This is a three-step process: creating a metric (of a given data type); registering the metric; tracking the metric.

Prometheus has a few different data types, but the simplest is a `Counter` - this is a counter which always goes up, and can be used to track, for example, the number of requests received (you can then divide this unit over time to calculate requests per second). To create a `Counter`, you can use the `prometheus` Go client, with `prometheus.NewCounter(opts)`, where `opts` is a `prometheus.CounterOpts` (a struct containing metadata - at minimum, a `Name`). You can store this in a global variable, like:

    var requestCounter = prometheus.NewCounter(prometheus.CounterOpts{Name: "requests_total"})

After creating a metric, you still won't see it appear in `/metrics` until it's been "registered". You can do this with `prometheus.MustRegister(metric)`, which will attempt to register the metric and panic if it fails (the non-panicing version also exists, as `prometheus.Register()`, but for this workshop, we recommend using `MustRegister()`). Then, you should be able to see your metric exposed on `/metrics` - success! (Except, it will still always report 0 - not quite useful, yet)

To use our metric in practice, we want to increment the counter when tracking events in our code. To increment the `Counter` type by one, we can simply call `.Inc()` - for example, using the request counter we created above, we could call:

    requestCounter.Inc()

You should add these `.Inc()` calls in the place in your code where the event you want to track is occuring.


### Section 3: Scraping Metrics with Prometheus

So far, we've been able to instrument our application, such that it is now exporting metrics about its runtime behaviour. However, we still need to collect those metrics and store the data in a way that we can query it back out, in order to graph it over time and make dashboards.

There is a `prometheus.yaml` configuration file here in the repo, which is already set up to scrape metrics from our application. We can run both our application and Prometheus inside Docker, so that they are easily able to find each other.

To build the application Docker image, and start the application container and Prometheus together, run the following command (from the root of this repo):

    docker-compose up --build

You should then be able to access the Prometheus dashboard on:

    http://localhost:9090

Prometheus should find and immediately start scraping metrics from the application container. You can check that it's found the application container by looking at the list of "targets" that Prometheus is scraping:

    http://localhost:9090/targets

### Section 4: Prometheus Queries

Prometheus using it's own query language called [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/). You can enter PromQL queries in the `/graph` page of the Prometheus UI.

To see the counter exported previously, we can use the PromQL query:

    requests_total

If we want to see this graphed as a rate per-second over time, we use the query:

    rate(requests_total[1m])

### Section 5: Making Dashboards with Grafana

[Grafana](http://grafana.com) is an open-source metric visualisation tool, which can be used to create dashboards containing many graphs. Grafana can visualise data from multiple sources, including Prometheus. The `docker-compose` command used in the previous section will also start a Grafana container, which uses the Grafana configuration file in this repo to connect to Prometheus. After running the startup command (same as above, `docker-compose up --build`), you'll be able to find Grafana on:

    http://localhost:3000

Grafana uses authentication, which, for this workshop, is configured in the `docker-compose.yaml` file. The credentials configured for this workshop are:

    username: ecosia
    password: workshop

#### Section 6: Metrics with Labels

Labels are a way of adding contextual information to your metrics (increasing their ["cardinality"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality)). For example, when tracking the count of requests received, it might be useful to also track the status code of the request. To do this, you can use `prometheus.NewCounterVec(opts)` instead of `prometheus.NewCounter(opts)`, and provide a list of label keys as the second argument - for example:

    requestCounter := prometheus.NewCounterVec(prometheus.CounterOpts{Name: "requests_total"}, []string{"status_code"})

Then, when tracking it, you'll need to provide the label values, which can be done like so:

    var status int
    if something.wasSuccessful:
        status = http.StatusOK
    else:
        status = http.StatusInternalServerError

    statusLabel := strconv.Itoa(status) // Label values must be strings

	requestCounter.WithLabelValues(statusLabel).Inc()
